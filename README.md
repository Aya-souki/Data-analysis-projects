# Data-analysis-projects
This repository contains the projects I've worked on concerning data analysis.
I used jupiter notebook to carry on my analysis and write my reports, using mainly python (especially the libraries pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, but also rquests, sqlearn, beautifulsoup, etc).
